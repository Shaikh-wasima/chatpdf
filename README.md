## Features

- **Chat Interface:** Engage in a conversation with the agent by asking questions and receiving responses.
- **PDF Document Ingestion:** Upload PDF documents to enhance the agent's knowledge base.
- **OpenAI Integration:** Utilizes OpenAI's language models for embeddings and language understanding.
